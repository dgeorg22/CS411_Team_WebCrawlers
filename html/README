Adding five new files that will perform all the basic CRUD functionality for the project (I hope).

Here are the things that need to be performed for these to work:

1. Modify the username, password and database name to correspond to the values of the system in question for all four php files.

2.  Create a database and users for the system in question.

TODO:

1.  Modularize the code to make function calls as much of the code can be reduced significantly.

2.  Make the appearance pretty at all.
